# 3-DOF-3D-Printed-Delta-Robot

Designed and fabricated a lightweight, low-cost planar manipulator using 3D-printed components and a four-bar linkage mechanism, including a custom motor-control PCB built with an Arduino Nano, A4988 stepper drivers, and NEMA-17 actuators.
Performed numerical optimisation of link dimensions to maximise the robot’s reachable workspace, validating the final geometry through kinematic analysis and prototype testing.
